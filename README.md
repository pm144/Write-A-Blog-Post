## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There is no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.x.

Three questions asked:
- Which location has the highest no. of people?
- Which programming languages are most used to work?
-  What is the employment status?


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this, I was interested in using Stackoverflow Developer Survey 2017 Data to better understand:
1. No. of peoples in each country
2. Which programming languages are most used to work
3. What is the employment status

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the dataset.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).
